# Technical Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Architecture & Design
- **SOLID Principles**
  - Single Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
  - Interface Segregation: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

- **Hexagonal Architecture**
  - Domain-centric design with clear boundaries
  - Business logic isolated from external concerns
  - Ports and Adapters pattern for infrastructure components
  - Domain model free from framework annotations
  - Use of interfaces for dependency inversion

### 2. Implementation Standards

#### API Design
- RESTful endpoints following REST maturity model level 2+
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with accessibility considerations
  - Include ARIA labels and screen reader friendly descriptions
  - Document keyboard navigation support
  - Specify content roles and states
- Use UUIDs for all entity identifiers
- Consistent error response format
- Versioning via Accept headers
- Rate limiting and security headers

#### Web Client Usage
- Use WebClient over RestTemplate for HTTP calls
  - Non-blocking reactive approach
  - Better error handling and timeout management
  - Support for streaming and backpressure
- Configure timeouts and circuit breakers
- Implement retry policies for resilience

#### Validation
- Bean Validation (JSR-380) for all DTOs
- Custom validation annotations when needed
- Validation groups for different contexts
- Comprehensive error messages
- Input sanitization for security

### 3. Testing Standards

#### Unit Testing
- Mockito for mocking dependencies
- AssertJ for fluent assertions
- BDD style: Given/When/Then
- Test naming convention: `methodName_scenario_expectedResult`
- One assertion per test (conceptually)

#### Integration Testing
- WireMock for external service simulation
- TestContainers for database testing
- Spring Boot Test for context testing
- Separate test configuration profiles

#### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% line coverage for service layer
- Minimum 80% branch coverage for service layer
- 100% coverage for critical business logic
- Mutation testing for critical components

### 4. Code Quality

#### Style & Formatting
- Spotless for automated formatting
- Google Java Style Guide base
- 120 character line length
- Consistent import ordering
- No wildcard imports

#### Security
- OWASP dependency check in CI
- Regular security updates
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure headers configuration
- HTTPS only in production
- Content Security Policy
- XSS prevention

#### Build & Dependencies
- Reproducible builds with version locking
- Bill of Materials (BOM) for version management
- Explicit dependency declarations
- Regular dependency updates
- Build time optimization

### 5. Documentation

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging

- Distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

### 7. Continuous Integration/Deployment

- Code coverage reports
- Static code analysis
- Security scanning
- Performance regression testing
- Automated deployment pipelines

### 8. Development Workflow
- Feature branch workflow
- PR review requirements
- Conventional commits
- Semantic versioning
- Release notes generation
- Automated changelog
